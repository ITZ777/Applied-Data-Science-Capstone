# Welcome to my SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Outcome Prediction Project. Here is a breakdown of some of the things i was able to achieve!
• Conducted detailed data analysis on 100+ SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, improving the prediction accuracy of first-stage booster
landings using Logistic Regression and SVM
• Built interactive dashboards with Python’s Plotly Dash, visualizing mission outcomes and enabling real-time insights
• Performed exploratory analysis using SQL Queries on a DB2 Database to extract launch data for further insights
